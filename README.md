# Conversion Web App

## General Info

- This semester I had to do a lot of conversions between three number systems (Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal).
- So I decided to create a little web app that does the conversion in real time and also shows the various steps.
- Didn't use any built in or imported functions for the conversions.

## Demo

- You can view it here [Number System Conversion](https://numbersystemconversion.netlify.app)
